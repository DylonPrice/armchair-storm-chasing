# Armchair Storm Chasing - Android

Armchair Storm Chasing was developed with the goal of allowing individuals interested in storm chasing but unable to actively participate themselves the chance to do so at their own convenience.

Developed for the Ball State University Capstone Series, 2017/2018

## Prerequisites

What you need before beginning development.

* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/)
* All dependencies listed in the 'Built With' section

## Code Notes

If you plan on developing Armchair Storm Chasing further, this section should help you get up to speed.

* DownloadDataAsync - This class pipes its result through `onPostExecute()` to wherever the delegate class calls the `onProcessFinish()` function found in IAsyncResponse.

* MapActivity - This class contains all the math for moving the user's current position along the line generated by the mapping system. The line contains an ArrayList of GeoPoints which can be iterated through to move the user's current location.

* XMLParser - The XML parser is extensible as long as you know what tags you are looking for. See the [official documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/network-ops/xml) for further details on the implementation used in Armchair Storm Chasing.
